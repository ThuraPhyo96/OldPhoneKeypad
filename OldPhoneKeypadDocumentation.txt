OldPhonePad.Run method() step by step working
=============================================
1. Initialize the Dictionary to store key value pairs and take the value by key
2. Initialize the 3 const: Star(Backspace), Hash(End of input) and Space(Delay) 
3. Take the input that enter from console and store it into input
4. If input is null or empty, then break out of the loop and ready for next input
5. If input has value, then convert the input into char array for iteration
6. Initialize the StringBuilder named output to store the convert number into letter
7. Traverse the input using the variable i and perform the following steps:
   1. store the current char 
   2. If current char is Star, then if output length is > 0, remove the last char from output and increment i by 1
   3. Else if current char is Hash, break out of the loop because the Hash is end of input
   4. Else if current char is Space, increment i by 1 and no action
   5. Otherwise, store the current char into sameCharCount
      Find the same char count, If i + 1 < input?.Length && currentChar is same next char, added the sameCharCount += next char.
	  If i == input?.Length, then break out of the loop
   6. Try to get the mapped char from mappings Dictionary
      If the value is valid, then appended the mapped char to the output 
8. After completing the above steps, If the output length is > 0 then print the value string output as the result.
9. Ready for next input
